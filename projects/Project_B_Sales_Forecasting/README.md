# Project B: Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting sales using historical data and machine learning techniques. The main goal is to build a robust model that can accurately forecast future sales based on past trends.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize the XGBoost algorithm to create a predictive model for sales forecasting. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IanLi-Data-Analytics-Projects.git
   cd IanLi-Data-Analytics-Projects/projects/Project_B_Sales_Forecasting
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the sales forecasting analysis, open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebook` directory:

- `Sales_Forecasting_with_XGBoost.ipynb`

This notebook contains the complete workflow from data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data

The data used in this project can be found in the `data` directory:

- `sales_data.csv`: This file contains the historical sales data used for training the model.
